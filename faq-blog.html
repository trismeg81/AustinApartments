      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>How much does your service cost?</h3>
      <p>It’s completely free for you! I get paid by the apartment complexes when you sign a lease and list me as your locator. I work with a TON of properties around Austin and just outside of it, there's nothing I can't find (as long as it's reasonable lol). </p>

      <h3>How do I get apartment deals?</h3>
      <p>Reach out! Shoot me a text, (972) 754-7790 I'm a fun guy! OR fill out the Google Form on the homepage and I’ll tailor a list based on your needs.</p>

      <h3>Can I work with you if I’m not in Austin yet?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely — I help lots of clients relocating. I can send walkthrough videos and guide you through it virtually.</p>

      <h3>How does this differ from apartments.com or some other apartment website?</h3>
      <p>I work with you individually and personalize the experience. I choose not to work with a lot of people so I can focus my attention on your needs. I have an edge by consistently knowing the deals that are happening around town at any moment. And in this business deals change daily. There's nothing worse than consistently reaching out to listings and not know if they're accurate. My job saves you time by pinpointing accurate listings and pricing and confirming accuracy.</p>

      <h3>How do your deals work?</h3>
      <p>I like to locate places offering a big special to bring your rent price well below market average. These specials vary from 2 weeks free to as much as 12 weeks free. I find the best specials out there and let you know about them, and how that will bring your rental rate down. If you prefer not to use specials, no problem. In that case, we'll find the best going rental rates at the best spots.</p>

      <h2>Neighborhood Spotlights</h2>

      <article style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h3>South Lamar (SoLa)</h3>
        <p>Trendy, walkable, and packed with food trucks, bars, and new apartments. Great for creatives and young professionals. I love this area for access to nature as well, with Zilker Park, Barton Springs, the Greenbelt, Lady Bird Lake, you've got great access to all you could ask for.</p>

      <article style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h3>East Austin</h3>
        <p>Culturally rich and rapidly growing. You’ll find everything from art murals to breweries and cozy studios to luxury lofts. I used to live in New York City, and closer to downtown on the Eastside is comparable to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Furthr out East is a great up and coming area that gives you a little more peace, but there's great new restaurants, bars, breweries, coffee shops, and activities out here now.</p>
